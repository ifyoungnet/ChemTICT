# ChemTICT
Interpretable machine learning deconstructs the structural essence of TICT&amp;PICT fluorophores
# Overview
This repository is not an independent software or package, it provides the original code and dataset for the project "<i>Interpretable Machine Learning Deconstructs the Structural Essence of TICT and PICT Fluorophores</i>". This project addresses the challenge of accurately distinguishing whether the charge transfer in D-Ï€-A type molecules exhibits TICT or PICT, while also providing accurate and practical AI-guided rules for the rational design of fluorophores with TICT and PICT.

## Key features
1. The First AI-Oriented Approach for TICT & PICT Exploration.
2. The unity of theoretical design and algorithmic guidance.

# System Requirements
This project is not limited to a specific hardware platform. Theoretically, it can run as long as the dependencies specified in the corresponding folder (`.yml`environment configuration file) are met.
Suggested hardware configuration is as follows: RAM: 16+ GB, CPU: 8+ cores, 3.3+ GHz per core; GPU (Optional): NVIDIA 3090Ti or higher`.
